# Simulating Pi interactively

Did you know that it's possible to simulate the number Pi? All you need to do
is draw a circle, then take some random points in the bounds defined by the
circle. The ratio of the points inside the circle to the total number of
points will be equal to Pi.

This notebook shows how you can simulate this using `ipywidgets` and `bqplot`.
