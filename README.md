# Simulating Pi interactively

Did you know that it's possible to simulate the number Pi? All you need to do
is draw a circle, then take some random points in the bounds defined by the
circle. The ratio of the points inside the circle to the total number of
points will be equal to Pi.

This notebook shows simulates this with:

* [**Voila**](https://github.com/quantstack/voila) to interactively build a dashboard from
  the [simulate_pi notebook](simulate_pi.ipynb)
* [**ipywidgets**](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) to build the
  components of the dashboard
* [**bqplot**](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) to create interactive, widget-friendly
  visualizations.
